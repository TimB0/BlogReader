This Blog Reader app taught me  one of the most common uses of an Android app: downloading data from the Internet and displaying it in a list. 
I painstakingly investigated the Model-View-Controller design patter that is essential for 
all Android apps, learned how to request data from the web, parse
and use information in JSON format, and utilize the built-in Android 
ListActivity and adapter.  I also learned how to display a webpage inside an 
app.
